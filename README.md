## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Transferring my knowledge of logic was the easy part, but the difficult part was getting using to the interaction between HTML and JS. The JS is essentially java but I had to make sure to reference the current elements from the HTML file.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I want to know how much modern web development is done by hand like we did in this project and how it has changed to be more automated (web-builders, etc.)

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Definitely get the timer function down. I tried using external resources but my timer wouldn't stop and I just commented it out to maintain my functioning project. I would also make use of more popups and try animations like fades, slides, etc.
